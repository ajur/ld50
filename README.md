# LD50 - "Grounded!"
Ludum Dare 50 entry  
Theme: **delay the inevitable**

Welcome to my first LudumDate game! :)  
*Be forgiving, it's my first entry in **any** game jam :)*

**Itch:** https://ajur.itch.io/ld50  
**Web or mobile:** https://ajur.pl/ld50/  
*(for now, rather not use itch for iOS, as its bugged)*

### Here's the pitch:

> You're reasonable teenager, whose friends convinced to throw a 
> house party while your parents are gone for the night.  
> As usually, things started to go out of control - unknown people started co came by, 
> while litter and broken stuff pops up with increasing rate.  
> All this time, being good host, you try to clean up and resolve as many issues as possible, 
> before things go over the top and someone calls your parents to go back.
> Tbh, it's inevitable, only question is, how long can you keep the party going? :grin:

I've crunched a bit to make it to the compo... but well, 
turn's out it was bit too much for the first time :sweat_smile: 
I'm glad there is new extra format :)


### How to play:
- Play in browser - game is mobile friendly :)
- Movement: WASD or touch/click anywhere for onscreen thumbstick (this can be changed to 'follow pointer' in menu)
- Find issues to solve (yellow and red circles) - stay for few seconds on issue circle to resolve it.

**Thanks for playing!**
